# Contribute to the project with new data

UDV is developed in the context of the [VCity research project](https://projet.liris.cnrs.fr/vcity/wiki/doku.php). 
One aspect of this project is to enhance numerical representations of cities
 with documents in order to highlight and share cultural heritage and
 to understand urban evolution.
 
You can help us achieving these goals by contributing data such as historical
 documents, pictures, maps, text, etc.

This account gives you **contributor** rights. This means that when you add a
document, it is not right away accepted. First, it needs to be validated by

published. See [Document validation process](#document-validation-process
) for more information.
