TO DO : auto install (install all dependencies with npm)

# INSTALL NOTES

First, the framework (itowns etc) must be installed : https://github.com/MEPP-team/RICT/blob/master/Install.md

Then, clone UDV alongside iTowns. UDV and iTowns must be in the same directory, unless you change the path to itowns in your index.html.
