TO DO : auto install (install all dependencies with npm)

# INSTALL NOTES

**Full install** : First, the framework (itowns + building server etc) must be installed : https://github.com/MEPP-team/RICT/blob/master/Install.md

Then, clone UDV alongside iTowns. UDV and iTowns must be in the same directory, unless you change the path to itowns in your index.html.

**Shorter install** : (should work to test CameraController) just clone UDV alongside iTowns, skipping the rest of the framework. Set "showBuildings" to false (line 4 in UDV/Vilo3D/Main.js).

**Launch** : open UDV/Vilo3D/index.html
