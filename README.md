# UDV

## Current features :

### Camera Controller

* **Left-click + drag** : User "grabs" the ground (cursor stays at the same spot on the ground) to translate camera on XY axis.
* **Right-click + drag** : camera rotation around the focus point (ground point at the center of the screen), clamped to avoid going under ground level.
* **Mousewheel** : smooth zoom toward the ground point under the mouse cursor, adjusted according to the ground distance (zoom is faster the further from the ground and cannot go through the ground).
* **Mousewheel click** (middle mouse button) : "Smart Zoom". Camera smoothly moves and rotates toward target ground point, at fixed orientation and adjusted distance.
* **S** : moves and orients camera to the start view 
* **T** : moves and orients camera to top view (high altitude and pointing toward the center of the city)

The camera controller has been merged into itowns ([PR](https://github.com/iTowns/itowns/pull/454)) and is now PlanarControls. It features an animation of camera movement and orientation (called "travel" in the code) which we use to orient the camera with a document (document **oriented view**).

### Document

* Basic support for **billboard** document : plane geometry with image as texture, oriented to face the camera (billboard behavior).
* Ability to access document metadata by clicking on the billboard.
* Orient the view when clicking on billboard.
* Document properties : source image, name, date, metada (short text), oriented view position, oriented view quaternion, billboard position
* All documents are loaded from a csv file (docs.csv) and can be accessed using the **Document Browser** window.

### Temporal

* Basic slider + input field to select a date
* Ability to navigate between key dates (arrow buttons)
* When we enter a document "oriented view", the date is updated to match the document's date
* Key dates correspond to a temporal version of the 3d models for the "ÃŽlot du Lac"
